    Data Analysis:
        Use machine learning models to classify dog activities based on sensor data.
        Handle different breeds, sizes, and activities.
    Dashboard:
        Provide real-time insights and historical trends through graphical visualizations.

        Implement automated workflows using data pipelines for continuous monitoring and analysis.

Python Code Example

This outline provides the basic components for data collection, processing, classification, and visualization.
1. Data Collection (Integration with IoT Devices)

We will assume the IoT devices are sending data via MQTT protocol or HTTP API. For simplicity, we'll use MQTT for real-time data collection.

Install Dependencies:

pip install paho-mqtt pandas matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

Sample MQTT Data Collection Script:

import paho.mqtt.client as mqtt
import json
import pandas as pd

# MQTT Broker Info
BROKER = "mqtt.eclipse.org"
PORT = 1883
TOPIC = "dog_activity/sensors"

# Data collection
sensor_data = []

# Callback when a message is received
def on_message(client, userdata, msg):
    try:
        # Convert message payload to JSON
        data = json.loads(msg.payload.decode())
        # Append data to sensor_data list
        sensor_data.append(data)
        print(f"Data Received: {data}")
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error processing data: {e}")

# Connect to the broker
client = mqtt.Client()
client.connect(BROKER, PORT)

# Subscribe to topic
client.subscribe(TOPIC)

# Set callback
client.on_message = on_message

# Start the MQTT client loop to listen for incoming messages
client.loop_start()

# Continuously collect data
import time
for _ in range(10):  # Collect for 10 seconds as a sample
    time.sleep(1)

# Convert collected data into a DataFrame
df = pd.DataFrame(sensor_data)
print(df.head())

2. Data Processing (Validation, Transformation, and Aggregation)

This script processes the collected data to clean and aggregate it into meaningful insights, such as detecting activity periods like walking, running, etc.

Sample Data Processing:

import numpy as np
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler

# Simulate sensor data for processing
# Assume columns ['timestamp', 'accelerometer_x', 'accelerometer_y', 'accelerometer_z']

df['timestamp'] = pd.to_datetime(df['timestamp'])
df.set_index('timestamp', inplace=True)

# Handle missing values (e.g., forward-fill)
df.fillna(method='ffill', inplace=True)

# Scale sensor data (Standardize accelerometer data)
scaler = StandardScaler()
df[['accelerometer_x', 'accelerometer_y', 'accelerometer_z']] = scaler.fit_transform(df[['accelerometer_x', 'accelerometer_y', 'accelerometer_z']])

# Aggregating data by minute
df_resampled = df.resample('1T').mean()  # Resample by 1 minute, taking mean for each minute

print(df_resampled.head())

3. Data Analysis (Activity Classification)

For activity classification, a machine learning model like Random Forest or a pre-trained deep learning model could be used. Below is a simple example using a decision tree classifier for classification based on accelerometer data.

Sample Activity Classification:

from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

# Simulate label data for activities
# 0 - Sleeping, 1 - Walking, 2 - Running, 3 - Eating
df_resampled['activity'] = np.random.choice([0, 1, 2, 3], size=len(df_resampled))

# Prepare training data (features: accelerometer data, target: activity)
X = df_resampled[['accelerometer_x', 'accelerometer_y', 'accelerometer_z']]
y = df_resampled['activity']

# Train a RandomForest classifier
model = RandomForestClassifier()
model.fit(X, y)

# Predict activities based on sensor data
df_resampled['predicted_activity'] = model.predict(X)

print(df_resampled[['accelerometer_x', 'accelerometer_y', 'accelerometer_z', 'predicted_activity']].head())

4. Visualization and User Interaction

A dashboard can be built using matplotlib and seaborn for real-time insights and historical analysis.

Sample Visualization:

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns

# Plotting the activity classification over time
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=df_resampled, x=df_resampled.index, y='predicted_activity')
plt.title('Dog Activity Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Activity (0=Sleeping, 1=Walking, 2=Running, 3=Eating)')
plt.show()

# Plotting sensor data (Accelerometer X)
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))
sns.lineplot(data=df_resampled, x=df_resampled.index, y='accelerometer_x')
plt.title('Accelerometer X Data Over Time')
plt.xlabel('Time')
plt.ylabel('Accelerometer X')
plt.show()

5. System Automation (Real-time Data Stream Processing)

For real-time data processing, we can use a message queue like Kafka, RabbitMQ, or AWS Kinesis. The automated pipeline would process incoming sensor data, validate it, classify activities, and update the dashboard.

This can be achieved by creating a message-processing loop that listens for new data and performs necessary steps (validation, transformation, classification) before pushing results to the dashboard.
Summary

    Data Collection: Uses MQTT for real-time data collection from IoT wearables.
    Data Processing: Includes cleaning, validation, and aggregation of sensor data.
    Data Analysis: Implements a machine learning model to classify dog activities like walking, running, sleeping, and eating.
    Visualization: Displays results on graphs that update in real-time.
    System Automation: Automates the data processing and classification pipeline using a message queue system.

This is a high-level outline of the required system and should be adapted to specific requirements, including integrating with hardware IoT devices and implementing specific user interfaces and cloud-based services for real-time interaction.
